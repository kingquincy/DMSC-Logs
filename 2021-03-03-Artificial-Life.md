## Not a Log - Artificial Life

The first artifical life program is a robotics simulator, which is a simulator that is used to create programming for an actual robot without the robot actually needing to be there, pretty much simulating what the robot __would__ do in real life, called RoboLogix. Robologix is used to emulate real robotic applications. It recieves signals that tell it if contact or collision between objects in the program has occcurred and it will return sensor information as feedback.

Although it may be a little questionable whether 'robotic simulation' is a form of artificial life. I think it can be argued that any form of robotics is a reproduction of human life, the process of having a robot made in order to make something on an assembly line is just a reproduction of human workers on an assembly line just more efficient. So if we agree that robotics in itself are a form of artifical life then I think it's safe to say that an emulation of real life robotics is also a form of artificial life. 

The next artificial life program is called Framsticks, a 3D artificial life simulator. This program creates 'organisms' with physical structures ("bodies") and control structures ("brains") that evolve over time depending on the environment that they're placed in. For example they evolve to become better swimmers over time if they're placed underwater. The evolution occurs by having an intellegent selector chose the selection parameters and mutation rates. The scripts of these 'organisms' are based on DNA from living organisms found in nature, the user can design the original creature as well as its genetic code.

This is a much more straight forward example of artificial life, the creator of this program had the intention of emulating living organisms through these 3D creatures they were creating. I think it's very interesting how these creatures 'evolve' over time through the use of artificail intelligence, you're able to get some kind of understanding of how living beings evolve over time depending on their environment.
