## Third Log - Artificial Life

The first artifical life program is a robotics simulator, which is a simulator that is used to create programming for an actual robot without the robot actually needing to be there, pretty much simulating what the robot __would__ do in real life, called RoboLogix. Robologix is used to emulate real robotic applications.

Although it may be a little questionable whether 'robotic simulation' is a form of artificial life. I think it can be argued that any form of robotics is a reproduction of human life, the process of having a robot made in order to make something on an assembly line is just a reproduction of human workers on an assembly line just more efficient. So if we agree that robotics in itself are a form of artifical life then I think it's safe to say that an emulation of real life robotics is also a form of artificial life.
