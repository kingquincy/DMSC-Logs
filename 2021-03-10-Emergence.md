## Third Log - Emergence and Artificial Life

To start off, from what I learned in the reading it seems that in the eyes of many that deal with artificial life, living organisms aren't very different from machines in the grand scheme of things, it looks as though the author of this reading is a strong believer that living beings are "nothing more than complex biochemical machines" which I guess in a manner of speaking is true, but that's manly due to that fact that machines were based off of humans, so it only makes sense that the two are similar. The author argues that natural life occurs through the interaction of its surroundings including living and non-living things and in that is where the idea of emergence lies. Emergence in artificial life is when new properties are able to arise through intereaction with other entities. 

There is an artificial life program called Framsticks, a 3D artificial life simulator. This program creates 'organisms' with physical structures ("bodies") and control structures ("brains") that evolve over time depending on the environment that their placed in. For example they evolve to become better swimmers over time if they're placed underwater. The evolution occurs by having an intellegent selector chose the selection parameters and mutation rates. The scripts of these 'organisms' are based on DNA from living organisms found in nature, the user can design the original creature as well as its genetic code.

The emergence in this program can be seen through the 'evolution' that occurs over time. The organisms created by this program interact with their environment and often with other generated organisms and through those interactions these organisms develop new properties in order to help them grow and improve or 'evolve'. This program even has 'agent-based systems' which facilitate these evolutions also allowing for coevolution. 

In regards to my own code ([Code without arrays](https://editor.p5js.org/quincywashington/sketches/IJjRw_Vy8); [Code with arrays](https://editor.p5js.org/quincywashington/sketches/MPpGu7A4v)) for my first creature that I created I made two 'creatures' that would be affected by the force of gravity, I also made it so that they collided with each other so that they are able to physically interact. So even without adding an array I think I was able to create some semblance of emergence. Despite the fact that they don't really change over time because of their interaction, I got the first part of emergence, the interaction itself, which is arguably the most important part.

After adding an array and making many different balls existing in this area, I unfortunately had to remove collision detection from the balls, purely because of my own lack of ability, which took away the more obvious showing of emergence, but having all these balls exist in this 'environment' is still shows emergence, even if they aren't physically interacting with each other they are still interacting with the environment when they bounce off the walls.
