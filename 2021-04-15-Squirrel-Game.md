I'll start off by saying I don't know about everyone else, but for me, this whole thing seemed way past my skill level, I feel like the majority of the things that we had to do in order to actually make the game work nobody in our group had any idea how to do, and then there were a lot of things that we could explain how it should work, but actually implementing it is where the problems arose, and of course, it didn't help that we weren't able to actually meet in person and were stuck online. One thing that we had an issue with was we wanted to animate the squirrel so we download a png of the frames from opengameart.org, but there wasn't a json file like how there was in the class example and we couldn't figure out how to do it without the json file, so we tried to use the gif version of the sprite, but the gif wasn't transparent, so we ended up cutting our losses and just using a png. I'm not completely clear on what 'procedurally generated' means really, but in my head it just means random, so for our 'procedurally generated' grass and flowers we just had them all placed randomly within the width and height of the screen. For the enemy squirrels, we had them placed randomly and they were moving using perlin noise, but we couldn't figure out how to get the enemy squirrels more spread out and moving around more, while also keeping the randomness. Another issue was, for the enemy squirrels we had them appear with a random size, but there were times when the squirrels would all generate and there would only be larger squirrels which obviously would just be an instant loss. The list of issues and things wrong could go on endlessly, but overall it was a really good learning experience, and I might be able to figure out a lot of the issues given more time.
