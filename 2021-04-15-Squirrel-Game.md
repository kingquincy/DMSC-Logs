I'll start off by saying I don't know about everyone else, but for me this whole thing seemed way past my skill level, I feel like the majority of the things that we had to do in order to actually make the game work nobody in our group had any idea how to do, and then there were a lot of things that we could explain how it should work, but actually implementing it is where the problems arised, and of course it didn't help that we weren't able to actually meet in person and were stuck online.
