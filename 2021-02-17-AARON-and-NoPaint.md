## Second Log - AARON and NoPaint

So to start off I read an article titled, Harold Cohen and AARON, a 40-year Collaboration, about a man and his robot turtle. This was actually a very interesting article about this 'AI system' called AARON. At first when I was reading this article and it mention ‘AI system’ I was expecting some type of art creating computer program not realizing at what time period this article was taking place. It was very interesting to read about what Henry Cohen was capable of creating in his day and age, and it was also interesting to see how he continuously advanced AARON from just drawing random shapes and ‘childish’ drawing, to biomorphic figures, and then eventually getting to the point where it was drawing and painting artworks that looked extremely similar to Cohen’s own earlier work, like robot creator like robot creation I guess. It’s said on the internet, mostly as a joke, that in the future comedy will be randomly generated, so when thinking of a theoretical tool to make some kind of artwork, that’s immediately where my head goes. I think of a computer program that analyzes jokes, memes, funny videos, etc. and is able to automatically generate short animated ‘comedy’ videos. There would obviously be times where the things that it generates might not inherently make sense and may need some human intervention in order to slightly fix it. I’m sure the kind of videos it would create would be not at all funny and extremely corny, but that’s the whole point, and maybe eventually it could even evolve and create videos that aren’t corny and just unfunny. It could be called ‘J0K3R’ or something, I don’t know. 
NoPaint is actually a really cool program to use, the complete randomness of it makes it possible to make hundreds of different artworks and have them all look completely different. I can tell that the actual different ‘brushes’ and filters aren’t useless, as I’m pretty sure I went through all of them, but the ways you can use them and the combinations with others is what is endless. I fully believe that this is my artwork rather than the computer’s or whoever else might be trying to take credit. I see the artwork that is made with this program comparable to many other types of digital art, I’m thinking of digital art that takes other photos and alters them and puts them together in order to create one coherent piece, despite that fact that maybe not all the images they used were originally made by them, the fact that they pretty much ‘choreographed’ the whole piece they are the artist. Despite the fact that all the brushes and filters were preprogrammed into NoPaint because I was the one that decided what would go in and what wouldn’t and when it would stop, I am no doubt the artist of the piece. Although I can say that the program along with the programmer are collaborators, but of course I get top billing. The pieces that I made are completely reliant on randomness as I had no idea what would appear next and where it would start on the piece, what I could control was whether to allow it onto my piece or not and when to stop it in order to move onto the next brush.
