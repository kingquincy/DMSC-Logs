## Fifth Log - Hydra

I can honestly say that when it comes to live coding I much prefer creating visuals rather than music, not that I don't like music, I just know that I'm much better at creating visuals, and I generally just find it more satisfying when I see the end results of visuals I create versus sounds. I really like the visuals you can create with Hydra, you're able to create some really aesthetically pleasing or even 'trippy' visuals which I think is really cool. It seems like a lot of the visuals that you're capable of making are really reminiscent of Windows screensavers in my opinion. I think the language is very intuitive, it has a bunch of functions that it lists on its resources page and you just input numbers within the parentheses in order to change certain parameters of the function, obviously, you can get more complex, adding more functions within functions, using math in place of numbers to get effects over time, and so on, but all the basic things you can do are very easy to understand and implement. In comparison to p5.js, from just Hydra's resources page, it seems that Hydra has significantly fewer functions in general compared to p5.js, which obviously makes sense when it comes to what both of these are capable of doing. Hydra seems to be made only for making visuals while on the other hand p5.js being a Javascript library has much much more functionality along with also being able to create visuals. One interesting thing about Hydra is that everything you do happens in order of what you type, which means you can create completely different visuals depending on the order you put the functions in.
