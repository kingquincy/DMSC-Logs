## First Log - Algorithmic Walk

First day of class, we started off how any other class would, the usual tell us your name and so and so about yourself, as expected, then we went off into talks about the syllabus and the class itself, all typical first day of class stuff. Then eventually we got into the meat of the class, we learned about an ancient programming language that was designed for children that ran on the Apple II computer. It is a really simple program that uses very straight forward commands to cause an arrow or a ‘turtle’ to move around the screen to create some kind of drawing. It uses commands like ‘Forward’, ‘back’, ‘repeat’, etc. making it a really good programming language for kids in order to introduce them to giving a text commands as well as understanding order for commands and such.

Using LOGO was a nice easy reentry into coding as it had been a couple months since I last coded something. We were posting our screenshots onto Discord and I was able to see all the drawings that everyone else was able to create, and my drawings looked pretty trash in comparison to some of them, but that just opened my eyes to how this seemingly simple programming language can be used for much more complex drawings in the hands of a much more creative, experienced person. It definitely makes me want to experiment more with this program and see how far I can push myself creatively with this. Overall I really liked this program, it’s a cool little program that you can just make little drawings on using very simple commands, and for its time there isn’t anything I could find wrong with it. In the future I want to try and create more complex drawings.



Algorithmic Walk Code
## Code:
> Exit Home
Turn Right
Repeat 4 times (
Walk Forward 3 blocks
Turn Left 
Walk Forward 2 blocks
If Pedestrian Signal shows walk (
Walk Forward 1 block) If Else (
Turn Right
Walk Forward 1 block)
Turn Random direction
)

After-Walk Response:
Ok, just finished my walk and I just wanna start off by saying I’m cold and tired and want to complain, at the end of the walk I surprisingly ended up on the same avenue that I started on just many, many blocks away from the start point. I ended up walking for a lot longer than I expected. I actually ran into more problems in my ‘code’ than I foresaw. To start off the blocks at the very start of my walk near my house, I forgot just how long they were, which caused the first blocks the I walked to be worth like twice the normal amount, which isn’t really a problem per say, but I’m lazy and wanted to complain about the extra walking I had to do. The first actual problem I ran into was I reached a dead end in only my first run through of my code which definitely threw me off, so I just decided that I would cut the ‘walk forward’ command I was currently running short then treat turning around as the next ‘turn’ command. My next problem occurred pretty much right after that, while I was in the process of walking forward the streets stopped and I could only turn left or right, so I again had to cut the ‘walk forward’ command I was currently running short and immediately move on to the next command of making a turn. I was faced with the issue of not being able to turn the direction that was specified in the code multiple time and instead had to turn in the opposite direction. 

I walked through many different areas that were unfamiliar to me, I got to areas that seemed extremely different from the streets I’m used to despite that fact that I still recognized all the street names. My biggest problems from my walk came from simply running out of street to walk and was at no fault of my own. My instructions were perfect and the streets just need to do a better job accommodating me and my instructions.
