## Fourth Log - Live Coding 

I think live coding is a very fun and interesting way to mix music making and coding. It's kind of confusing at first, similar to pretty anything when you first learn, but once you get the hang of it you see how simple it can actually be. I'm sure the things we learned in class don't even scratch the surface of what you're capable of doing with TidalCycles, but even from that small amount it seems like there's so much possibility. I don't really have experience making music, but when I was taking Introduction to Sound, I made a lot of music using Audacity, which is obviously not ideal for music making, and it was a lot of tedious moving and editing bass and treble, etc., but for live coding you can pretty much just write out what you want and add bass, change the volume, even have it pan between headphones, etc. It just seems like such an efficient way to make music, especially from a coders standpoint. Then you can use all the different boxes as different tracks and have them all overlayed over each other.
