## Fourth Log - Live Coding 

I think live coding is a very fun and interesting way to mix music making and coding. It's kind of confusing at first, similar to pretty much anything when you first learn, but once you get the hang of it you see how simple it can actually be. I'm sure the things we learned in class don't even scratch the surface of what you're capable of doing with TidalCycles, but even from that small amount it seems like there's so much possibility. I don't really have experience making music, but when I was taking Introduction to Sound, I made a lot of music using Audacity, which is obviously not ideal for music making, and it was a lot of tedious moving and editing bass and treble, etc., but for live coding you can pretty much just write out what you want and add bass, change the volume, even have it pan between headphones, etc. simply by adding it in through coding. It just seems like such an efficient way to make music, especially from a coders perspective. Then you can use all the different boxes as different tracks and have them all overlayed over each other in order to create a really complex beat.

I would actually be interested in learning more about this live coding thing to see how much you're actually capable of doing. There just seems like there's so much versatility to this because it would probably be easy to connect this with other coding works as it is coding itself, adding another layer to coding projects.
